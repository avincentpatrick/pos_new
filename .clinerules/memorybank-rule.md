## Integrating Font Awesome Locally in a Laravel Vite Project

When replacing a Font Awesome CDN link with a local copy in a Laravel project using Vite, simply downloading the CSS file is not enough. The CSS file contains relative paths to font files (e.g., `.woff2`, `.ttf`) which also need to be available locally.

### Problem

After downloading the Font Awesome CSS and linking it locally, the browser console shows 404 (Not Found) errors for font files like `fa-solid-900.woff2`. This happens because the font files themselves were not downloaded.

### Solution

1.  **Create Directories**: Ensure the necessary directories exist in your `public` folder.
    ```bash
    mkdir public\css
    mkdir public\webfonts
    ```

2.  **Download CSS**: Download the Font Awesome CSS file into the `public/css` directory.
    ```bash
    curl -o public/css/fontawesome.css https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/all.min.css
    ```

3.  **Download Font Files**: Download the required font files from the CDN's `webfonts` directory into your local `public/webfonts` directory. The paths are relative to the CSS file's location on the CDN.
    ```bash
    curl -o public/webfonts/fa-solid-900.woff2 https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/webfonts/fa-solid-900.woff2
    curl -o public/webfonts/fa-solid-900.ttf https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/webfonts/fa-solid-900.ttf
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to download other font files like `.svg`, `.eot` depending on browser support requirements.)*

4.  **Update Blade Template**: Modify the main layout file (e.g., `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`) to use the local CSS file with Laravel's `asset()` helper. The relative paths (`../webfonts/`) inside the CSS will now correctly point to your local `public/webfonts` directory.
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/fontawesome.css') }}" />
    ```

This process ensures the project is self-contained and all assets are loaded correctly without relying on external CDNs.

## Project Analysis: Point of Sale (POS) System - Updated

### Overview

The analyzed project is a full-stack Point of Sale (POS) system designed for managing sales, inventory, and customer data. Recent updates have focused on enhancing the cash management process during shift operations, ensuring transaction integrity, refactoring payment handling, improving the delivery batch finalization process, and refining stock movement tracking for dispensed and returned items. New pages for Stock Movement Monitoring and Expense Management have been added for administrators. A new "Promos and Discounts" module has been added for managing promo packages and special price sets.

### Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: Laravel
*   **Frontend**: Livewire, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for asset management. This combination is often referred to as the TALL Stack.
*   **Database**: The application uses a relational database with tables for products, stocks, clients, sales, payment methods, duty logs, denominations, cash counts, cash count items, transactions, payments, delivery batches, stock movements, expenses, expense types, promo packages, special price sets, promos, special prices, client promos, and client special prices.

### Key Features

*   **Sales Management**: Components like `AddSale` and `CashierModule` handle the core sales process.
*   **Inventory Control**: `ProductList`, `StockList`, and `StorageModule` are used for managing product inventory.
*   **Customer Relationship Management**: `ClientList` suggests functionality for managing customer data.
*   **Administration**: An `AdminModule` is present for administrative oversight.
*   **Enhanced Cash Management**: Detailed cash denomination counting for both "Start Shift" and "End Shift" operations.
*   **Transaction Integrity**: Transactions are now explicitly linked to the active cashier's duty log.
*   **Remittance Page**: A new page for managing COD transactions and client credit payments.
    *   **Enhancement**: Displays both adjusted and original total amounts for COD transactions to indicate price adjustments due to returns.
*   **Delivery Batch Finalization**: Improved drag-and-drop functionality for assigning transactions to delivery batches, with temporary removal from pending list and permanent removal upon finalization. Visual enhancements for better UI contrast and consolidated batch information.
    *   **Enhancement**: Pending transactions for delivery now exclude returned items and require a dispense record. The table is real-time, updating every 5 seconds.
    *   **Enhancement**: `DeliveryBatch` status is updated to 'Completed' (ID 2) when any associated transaction is marked as 'Completed' or 'Returned' in `FulfillOrdersModule`.
*   **Fulfill Orders Module**: A new module has been implemented to manage pending and fulfilled sales orders. This includes:
    *   Displaying "Pending Transactions for Dispense" and "Fulfilled Orders" lists.
    *   A "Dispense" button for pending transactions that, when clicked, creates a record in the `stock_movements` table.
    *   Dynamic computation of stock based on the `stock_movements` table, without directly decrementing product stock in the `products` table.
    *   Enhanced "View" modal for fulfilled orders, allowing updates to status (Completed/Returned), capturing `actual_quantity_dispensed`, `actual_quantity_returned`, `return_reason_id`, and `return_remarks`.
    *   **Enhancement**: When a transaction is marked as 'Completed' or 'Returned', its parent `DeliveryBatch` is updated to 'Completed' (ID 2). The pending transactions table is real-time, updating every 5 seconds.
*   **Stock Movement Monitoring**: A new page for administrators to monitor stock movements in real-time.
    *   **Enhancement**: Replaced searchable dropdown for storage shifts with a date picker. Displays selected storage shift details (User, Time In, Time Out).
    *   **Enhancement**: Discrepancy formula in product summary is `Closing Count - Running Stock`, where `Running Stock = Start Count + Restocks - Initial Dispensed + Returns`.
*   **Expense Management**: A new page for administrators to manage expenses.
    *   **Features**: List expenses, search by type or specify, filter by expense type, pagination, and an "Add Expense" modal.
    *   **CRUD**: Implemented Add, Edit, and Delete (with admin password confirmation) functionalities.
    *   **Conditional Display**: `expense_type_specify` field is only shown if `expense_type_id` is 8 (for 'Other' expenses).
*   **Promos and Discounts**: A new module for managing promo packages and special price sets.
    *   **Features**: List promo packages and special price sets, search, pagination, and add/edit/delete functionality.
    *   **Client Application**: Ability to apply promo packages and special price sets to clients. A client can have one promo package and one special price set at a time.
    *   **Sales Integration**: The `AddSale` component automatically applies special prices and promos for the selected client.

        *   `render()`: Fetches COD transactions and client credit payments (both now query `Transaction` with `payments` relationship and filter by dynamic `remaining_balance`). `PaymentMethod::all()` is cached. Includes logic to re-filter clients if `searchClient` is set and no client is selected.
        *   **Enhancement**: Added listener for `transactionUpdated` event to refresh data on returns.

            *   Clears `$pendingTransactionsByBatch[$batchId]` and refreshes `loadTransactions()` and `loadActiveDeliveryBatches()`.
        *   `printSelectedBatches()`:
            *   Renders `delivery-batch-print.blade.php` with selected batches.
            *   Returns a JavaScript response to open a new window and print the rendered HTML.
        *   **Enhancement**: `render()` method now calls `loadTransactions()` to ensure real-time updates on poll.
        *   **Enhancement**: `wire:key` attributes added to delivery batch elements in the Blade view for better reactivity.

            *   **Fulfilled Orders Query**: Fetches `Sale` models with `product`, `transaction.orderType`, `transaction.client`, and `stockMovements.dispenseStatusType` relationships. It filters for sales that have a `stockMovement` record with `dispense_status_type_id` of 'Ongoing Delivery' or 'Completed'.
        *   `dispenseOrder($saleId)`: Creates a `StockMovement` record to mark an order as dispensed. For "Pick-up" orders, `actual_quantity_dispensed` is automatically set to the `sale->quantity`.
        *   `viewOrder($saleId)`: Loads a specific sale's details into a modal, initializes `$selectedStatusId`, `$actualQuantityDispensed`, `$actualQuantityReturned`, and `$return_remarks` from the existing `stockMovement` record. Also loads all `ReturnReason` options.
        *   `updateFulfilledOrder()`: Validates inputs.

        *   `checkShiftStatus()`: Checks for an active storage duty log.
        *   `openStartShiftModal()`: Resets validation and quantities for the start shift modal.
        *   `startShift()`: Creates `StorageDutyLog`, `StockCount` (type 1), and `StockCountItems` records. **Enhancement**: Now also creates `Stock` records for each product with a quantity greater than 0, linking them to the current `storage_duty_log_id`.
        *   `openEndShiftModal()`: Resets validation and quantities for the end shift modal.
        *   `endShift()`: Validates, updates `StorageDutyLog` status, creates `StockCount` (type 2) and `StockCountItems` records. Generates a shift report. **Update**: The `systemComputedRemainingStock` calculation now excludes `startQuantity` (i.e., `restocks - initialDispensed + returns`) because starting quantities are now added directly to `stocks` and are thus included in `restocks`.
        *   `render()`: Renders the storage module view.

*   **`app/Livewire/StockMovementMonitoring.php`**:
    *   **Properties**: `$selectedProductId`, `$selectedStorageDutyLogId`, `$selectedDate`, `$selectedStorageDutyLog`, `$startDate`, `$endDate`, `$currentActiveStorageDutyLogId`, `$products`, `$storageDutyLogs`, `$productSummary`.
    *   **Methods**:
        *   `mount()`: Initializes products, storage duty logs, and date filters. Sets default `selectedStorageDutyLogId` and `selectedDate` to the current active shift if one exists.
        *   `render()`: Fetches and combines stock additions and dispensing movements into a single, sorted timeline. Calculates a product summary based on the filtered data.
        *   `calculateProductSummary()`: Calculates the "Start Count", "Restocks", "Dispensed", "Returns", "Running Stock", and "Loss" for each product based on the filtered data. **Update**: The `runningStock` calculation now excludes `startCount` (i.e., `restocks - initialDispensed + returns`) because starting quantities are now added directly to `stocks` and are thus included in `restocks`.
        *   The component uses `wire:poll.5s` for real-time updates.
        *   **Enhancement**: Replaced searchable dropdown for storage shifts with a date picker. Displays selected storage shift details (User, Time In, Time Out).
        *   **Enhancement**: Discrepancy formula in product summary is `Closing Count - Running Stock`, where `Running Stock = Start Count + Restocks - Initial Dispensed + Returns`.

*   **`app/Livewire/ClientDetail.php`**:
    *   **Enhancement**: "Total Sales" now sums `adjusted_total` of all transactions.
    *   **Enhancement**: "Total Credit" now sums `adjusted_total` of transactions with `payment_method_id = 3` (Credit).

*   **`app/Livewire/ExpenseList.php`**:
    *   **New Feature**: Expense management page with list, search, filter, pagination, and add/edit/delete functionality.
    *   **Conditional Display**: `expense_type_specify` field is only shown if `expense_type_id` is 8.
